		<line><rumble>Aaaaarggahagahh!!</rumble></line>
		<line>...</line>
		<line>Ya'see?</line>
		<line>That's probably how them losers will react.</line>
		<line>Of course, boyo, put yourself in their shoes : they're going here on <big><wave>holidays</wave></big>.</line>
		<line>Human brain is entirely jammed by desperation, city rumble, <rumble>capitalism</rumble>...</line>
		<line>So, by looking upon <b><color value="#DA3E52">a lil boyo</color></b> like ya...</line>
		<line>Hey, out of context, glad to meet you, I'm Topo.</line>
		<line>And you... ya name is...?</line>
		<line><wave>Huuuuum...</wave></line>
		<line>Not-the-talkative-type.</line>
		<line>So... ya will be so nice to catch up on family's news, ya'd be so cool.</line>
		<line>Do it your way, stomp it, don't know.</line>
		<line>That's easy: we're <b><color value="#A2D729">four Mwi Mwi</color></b> on the island!</line>
		<line>Me, <b><color value="#FA824C">Ani</color></b>, <b><color value="#FFB400">Aou</color></b> and <b><color value="#81F495">Taka</color></b>.</line>
		<line>Oh... maybe you can warm up yourself with a little trick, I've just imagined.</line>
		<line>Do you see that bunch of lying flat tourists, eh?</line>
		<line>They're <big>sunbathing</big>.</line>
		<line><rumble>BUT</rumble>, the curious thing is they're often doing that as a group.</line>
		<line>Just think you've found <b><color value="#84C318">a lone sunbathing tourist</color></b>... he's cool, cause he's alone...</line>
		<line>But you're bursting up with an umbrella, to ruin his precious sunbathing spot!!</line>
		<line>That would be <wave>soooooo</wave> fun.</line>
		<line>Umbrella + lone sunbather = tons of success for us.</line>

		<line>Here, nothing new, the old story, haha.</line>
		<line>May believe that night never comes, hehe.</line>
		<line>Or else, waves are still <wave>waving</wave>, and sun is... "sunning", ya'see.</line>
		<line>Don't mind my gobbledygook.</line>
		<line>You have more interesting to do, no doubt.</line>
		<line>Crush holidays, ruin the fun...</line>
		<line>Remember : the lone tourist is near the rocky mossy mess, up there.</line>
